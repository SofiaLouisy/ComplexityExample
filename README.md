# [README]

This project aims to perform two different sorting algorithms:
* Insert sort
* Merge sort

The complexity of the two different algorithms should be described and compared using O-notation.

The importance of sorting lies in the fact that data searching can be optimized to a very high level, if data is stored in a sorted manner.
