Types:

- In-place sorting (needs no extra space for temporary storing)
- Not-in-place sorting (needs extra space)
- Stable sorting (equal elements do not exchange order)
- Unstable sorting (equal elements has changed order)
- Adaptive sorting (Takes advantage of already sorted elements)
- Non-adaptive sorting (Resorts already sorted elements)

Terms:

-Increasing order (1,3,4,6,8,9)
-Decreasing order (9,8,6,4,3,1)
-Non-Increasing order (9,8,6,3,3,1)
-Non-decreasing order (1,3,3,6,8,9)
